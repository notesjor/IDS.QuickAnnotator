Algorithms

This library implements Myer's diff algorithm which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff. 
A layer of pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.
This library also implements a Bitap matching algorithm at the heart of a flexible matching and patching strategy.
